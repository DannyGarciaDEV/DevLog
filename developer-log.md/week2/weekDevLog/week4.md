# Weekly Summary - Week 4

## 🛠️ Overview
This week was a mix of learning, completing coding challenges, and navigating team dependencies. I made progress in my personal studies while also keeping up with ongoing project work.  

## 📚 Key Learnings
I spent time learning about large language models through a 1-hour YouTube video. It helped me better understand how they work, how they “think,” and their overall functionality.  

## ✅ Wins & Progress
- Finished my NeetCode problems and completed my weekly hitlist.  
- Continued working on personal habits, especially waking up earlier, though still aiming to improve.  

## ⚠️ Challenges & Blockers
- Progress is still slowed down by waiting on others to finish their tickets.  

## 🔜 Focus for Next Week
- Finish my own ticket so I can participate fully in retrospectives.  

## 📝 Reflections
I’m feeling a bit stressed, but I know patience is key. I need to focus on staying steady and improving small things along the way.

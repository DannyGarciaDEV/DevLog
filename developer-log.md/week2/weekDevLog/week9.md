🗓️ Weekly Summary — Nov 03 to Nov 05
🛠️ Overview

This week, I worked on fine-tuning NanoChat using the GPU server. The model successfully finished training, but I accidentally forgot to save the results before terminating the session — which caused me to lose all progress. When I tried to retrain it, the setup didn’t work properly due to missing dependencies or GPU-related issues.

I also started implementing the store feature for the chatbot (as Kaia suggested for Manny’s ticket). However, due to the technical issues, I decided to move forward with my next task — fixing Practice Chat and Mode.

📚 Key Learnings

Learned how long it takes for a model to fully train.

Got hands-on experience using a GPU server — very cool!

✅ Wins & Progress

Completed a full model training process on GPU (before losing progress).

Improved my understanding of fine-tuning workflows and server setups.

⚠️ Challenges & Blockers

Time management between work and training sessions was difficult.

Lost training progress due to not saving the model before termination.

GPU server issues made retraining challenging.

🔜 Focus for Next Week

Consider paying for my own server to have better control over training time.

Fix issues with NanoChat and resume fine-tuning.

Finish and post my hackathon project.

📝 Reflections

This week was a mix of frustration and learning. Losing progress was tough, but it taught me the importance of saving checkpoints and managing training workflows better. I’m still motivated to improve the chatbot and refine my setup to avoid similar issues in the future.

Weekly Summary – Oct 27–31
📚 Key Learnings

Took a deep dive into NanoChat, exploring how it works and how easy it is to use and modify the code.

✅ Wins & Progress

I completed mock interviews, even though the week was very hectic with work and personal matters.

I was proud of myself for managing my time between work and interviews.

The feedback I received from the mock interviews was really helpful — I’m improving my storytelling skills and learning how to make my responses more engaging.

I also learned that it’s okay to skip a question if I don’t have a relevant story prepared.

⚠️ Challenges & Blockers

I’ve been focusing on improving how I talk about my professional experience and describe the details on my resume more effectively.

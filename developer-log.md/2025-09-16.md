# Dev Log - 2025-09-16

## Todayâ€™s Focus
- Finished NeetCodes and Push them to github
- print out new paper Leon gave us during lunch and learn.
- start crafting ai app for learning

## Wins / What I Learned
-  Based on the Reading [The 2 Sigma Problem](https://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf) I learn traditional classrom is okay, mastery learning = +1 sigma ensurance most students achieve, and tutoring = +2 sigma avaerage student becomes top. Fututre education work because of personalization correction, feedback and mastering pacing. (Same as Resilient Coders in some ways) [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NNPd82cxmLmUHQZ9I8Gng5fgTW8KRL7i5lPQPgwmhvU/edit?usp=sharing)
